Credit scorecards are widely used in the financial industry as an effective risk management tool. By analyzing personal information and data provided by credit card applicants, these models predict the likelihood of future defaults or repayment behavior. This enables banks to make informed decisions about whether to approve or decline credit card applications, ensuring responsible lending practices and mitigating financial risk.
